# Maximising-Customer-Retention-in-Credit-Card

Credit card issuers are facing a significant challenge with a growing number of cardholders using their cards less frequently or closing their accounts altogether. This trend is leading to a decline in the total number of credit cards held by consumers, coupled with a decrease in new applicants. To address this issue, the objective is to develop a customer database model capable of predicting which customers are most likely to close their accounts. By identifying specific customer characteristics, issuers can implement targeted marketing and relationship strategies to enhance retention and boost customer profitability.


Real-World Factors that Contribute to Customer Attrition In The Credit Card Industry:
1. Changing Customer Needs
2. Poor Customer EXperience
3. Financial Hardship and etc..

Key Objectives of this Project:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Development and Evaluation


The Random Forest model exhibits robust performance in predicting customer attrition, showcasing high accuracy, F-Score, and AUC. It effectively identifies the majority of instances of attrition while keeping false positives to a minimum. These results indicate that the model can serve as a valuable tool for business managers in pinpointing customers at risk of attrition. By leveraging the model's accuracy, precision, and AUC values, managers can implement targeted retention strategies to mitigate customer churn and foster long-term customer relationships, ultimately contributing to business growth and sustainability.
